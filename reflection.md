- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

    Our class PetShelter represents a shelter that holds and cares for different animals. It add new animals to their registry, assigning them a breed, animal type, age, and health status. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

1. getName() returns out the pets name
2. getAge() returns out the age of the pet
3. animalType() returns the type of animal
4. breed() returns the breed of the pet
5. printRegistry() prints out all the availible for adoption according to the array

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I was a bit confused by the contract but I understand it better now. I realized that our code does have some logical errors however. Due to the way the petShelther is written, the first few methods only works with the first pet initialized with the instance. 

If I had time to fix this, I would first add a method to be able to add animals. I would not have the current variables initialized in the contructor present. I would want to use something similar to a dictionary in Python to store multiple variables to a key. I'm unsure if an array is able to do this exactly.
